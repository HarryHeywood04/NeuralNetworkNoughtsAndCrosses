## Description
This project provides a way to easily make neural networks and test them in a game of noughts and crosses.
The model_creator file creates and saves neural networks using the settings in the file.
The game file then loads the selected model and puts it into a game of noughts and crosses.

## The bots
Included is 2 bots, multi and nexus:
- Nexus is made up of 1 hidden layer with 128 nodes.
- Multi is made up of 2 hidden layers with 24 and 52 nodes.
